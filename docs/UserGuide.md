<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: &nbsp; Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add-expense t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Bubble Tea`.

* Items in square brackets (`[]`) are optional.<br>
  e.g `t/TITLE [c/CATEGORY]` can be used as `t/Bubble Tea c/Food & Beverage` or as `t/Bubble Tea`.

* Items in square brackets, with `...` after the parameter, can be used multiple times (including zero times).<br>
  e.g. `[c/CATEGORY...]` can be used as `c/Food & Beverage`, `c/Food & Beverage c/Tea` etc, or even omitted completely.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `t/TITLE a/AMOUNT`, `a/AMOUNT t/TITLE` is also acceptable.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:warning: &nbsp; IMPORTANT &nbsp; :warning:**<br>

The formats of the parameters used in the rest of the document are as follows:
* `TITLE`, `TITLE_KEYPHRASE` and `CATEGORY` should consist of letters and/or numbers.
* `AMOUNT`, `AMOUNT_FROM` and `AMOUNT_TO` should each be a non-negative number with up to 8 digits before the decimal point and with 0 or 2 decimal places.
  An optional `$` may be included in front as well.
* `DATE`, `DATE_FROM` and `DATE_TO` should each be a valid calendar date in `dd/mm/yyyy` format, representing day, month, and year respectively.
  * For day and month values, single-digit values must be padded with leading zeroes, meaning that a value of 5 should be written as `05` instead of `5`.
  * For year values, it must be written in the standard 4-digit format, so 2019 should be written as `2019` and not just `19`.
  * Dates cannot be later than the current date.
* `INDEX` should be a positive integer.

### 4.6 Bookmark Income

A **bookmark income** is a template that allows you to create incomes that you make frequently, such as your monthly salary or stipend for being a teaching assistant.
You can convert a bookmark income repeatedly to create as many incomes as you want, and the created incomes will automatically be added to Fine<span>$</span><span>$</span>e's incomes list.

To help you manage your finances, Fine\$\$e records the following information about each of your bookmark incomes:
1. **Title**: A descriptive title, to remind you what the bookmark income is about.
1. **Amount**: How much money you would have received each time you convert the bookmark income into an income.
1. **Categories**: Any number of categories, to help you group related bookmark incomes together.

### 4.10 Clear Data: `clear`

Ready to start using Fine\\$\\$e after fiddling with the sample data? Want to start over your finance tracking journey on a clean slate?
This command allows you to clear *all* existing data inside the finance tracker. That includes:
* Expenses and incomes
* Bookmark expenses and bookmark incomes
* Monthly expense limit
* Monthly savings goal

Format: `clear`

> :warning: &nbsp; This is a powerful command. You might lose your precious data if you are not careful with it.

> :bulb: &nbsp; If there is any data you would like to keep before clearing, save it somewhere so that you can re-enter it later.

To protect against accidental usage, this command needs to be entered **twice in succession** before it takes effect.
A single `clear` command is nullified when not followed by another `clear` command.

Here are some example scenarios to illustrate:
* Scenario A: Enter `clear`, then enter `clear` again.
  * The finance tracker data is cleared.
* Scenario B: Enter `clear`, then enter `lsi` (a command), then enter `clear` again.
  * The finance tracker data is unchanged.
  * The first `clear` command has been nullified, so Fine\\$\\$e requests for a second `clear` command as confirmation.
* Scenario C: Enter `clear`, then enter `lsi`, then enter `clear` again, then enter `clear` yet again.
  * The finance tracker data is cleared.

Example Usage:
```
clear
```

Expected Outcome:
```
Please enter 'clear' again to confirm your decision.
```

Example Usage (continued):
```
clear
```

Expected Outcome:
```
Finance tracker has been cleared!
```
All data in the finance tracker is cleared.

  * Each press of the ↑ arrow key retrieves the command immediately preceding the current command.
  * If the current command is the earliest command that is being tracked, then pressing the ↑ arrow key does nothing.
