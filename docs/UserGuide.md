* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add-expense t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Bubble Tea`.
  Any leading/trailing whitespaces will be ignored. e.g. `add t/   Bubble Tea` and `add t/Bubble Tea   ` will be treated as `add t/Bubble Tea`.

* Items in square brackets (`[]`) are optional.<br>
  e.g `t/TITLE [c/CATEGORY]` can be used as `t/Bubble Tea c/Food & Beverage` or as `t/Bubble Tea`.

* Items in square brackets, with `...` after the parameter, can be used multiple times (including zero times).<br>
  e.g. `[c/CATEGORY...]` can be used as `c/Food & Beverage`, `c/Food & Beverage c/Tea` etc, or even omitted completely.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `t/TITLE a/AMOUNT`, `a/AMOUNT t/TITLE` is also acceptable.

* Any leading/trailing whitespaces for the user input as a whole will be ignored. e.g. `   find t/Bubble Tea   ` will be treated as `find t/Bubble Tea`.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

  An optional `$` may be included in front as well.

### 4.10 Clear Data: `clear`

Ready to start using Fine\\$\\$e?
This command allows you to clear *all* existing data inside the finance tracker. That includes:

Format: `clear`

> :warning: &nbsp; This is a powerful command. You might lose your precious data if you are not careful with it.

To protect against accidental usage, this command needs to be entered **twice in succession** before it takes effect.

* Scenario B: Enter `clear`, then enter `clear` again.
  * The finance tracker data is cleared.
* Scenario C: Enter `clear`, then enter `lsi` (a valid command), then enter `clear` again.
  * The finance tracker data is unchanged.
  * The first `clear` command has been nullified, so Fine\\$\\$e requests for a second `clear` command as confirmation.
* Scenario D: Enter `clear`, then enter `foo` (an invalid command), then enter `clear` again.
  * The finance tracker data is unchanged.
  * The first `clear` command has been nullified, so Fine\\$\\$e requests for a second `clear` command as confirmation.
* Scenario E: Enter `clear`, then enter `lsi`, then enter `clear` again, then enter `clear` again.
  * The finance tracker data is cleared.

Example Usage:
```
