### Updated Architecture

Issue: Need to support UI-dependent behaviour for commands.

Solution: Pass the UI state to the command parser.

### Actionables

Wei Liang:
- Create {Add, Delete} × {Expense, Income} Command
  - Generic `AddCommand` that works based on the current `UiState`

Ian:
- Add UiState (Partially done)
- Create {Edit, List} × {Expense, Income} Command
  - Generic `ListCommand` that works based on the current `UiState`

Yong Ping:
- Edit `ModelManager.getFilteredTransactionList`
- Remove `TransactionList`

Jingjing:
- Make `Transaction` abstract
- Generic `FindCommand` that works based on the current `UiState`

Siddarth: 
- Adding left side panel in the main window
- Change menu tabs to tab panel
- Center categories 
- Show expense list and income lists in the respective panels (hook logic to UI)
