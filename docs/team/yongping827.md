## Project: Fine$$e

### Overview

Fine$$e is a desktop finance tracker that allows tertiary students to better manage their finances, cultivating good financial habits such as saving. It is optimised for CLI users so that expenses and income can be tracked efficiently by typing in commands. It is written in Java, and has a GUI created with JavaFX.

### Summary of Contributions

  * Justification: This feature gives the user a visualization of the quantitative information in monthly budget so that the user can view their spending and saving trends.
  * Highlights: This feature required the use of JavaFX charts.
